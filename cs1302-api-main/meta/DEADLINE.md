## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the
> the primary functions available to users of the app. Be sure to
> describe exactly what APIs you are using and how they are connected
> in a meaningful way.

> **Also, include the GitHub `https` URL to your repository.**

App Description: This app provides users a randomized meal in a category of their choosing from a dropdown. The first API I used was the MealDb API, is used to generate a meal that belongs to one of the dropdown categories (Starters, breakfast, etc.). The demonym or nationality of the meal is also saved from this API call. Then, the saved demonym of the meal is used to filter and search the second API (jsonmock hackerrank countries API) in order to display further information regarding that nationality. The information provided about the nationality includes the name of the country, capital city, and native name of country. The app provides this further information about the nationality of this meal, a picture of this meal, and the recipe instructions for the meal upon clicking the appropriate buttons.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?


Upon working on this project, I was able to learn about unique JavaFx graphics (for example, to create font with reflection). It was exciting to see the similarities and differences between JavaFx graphics and stying and normal html and css styling. It was also exciting to be able to connect two APIs in a meaningful way, and learning to use the response of one api in order to use a second api.
## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?


If I could start the project over from scratch, I would like to use another API for my countries api (second api). I would like to have used an API that would show the country on a map, perhaps a google api would be best fit for that. It would be cool to have a visual of the origin place of the meal generated. I would also liked to have used an API that would allow me to show the youtube video of the recipe and cooking process instead of displaying the recipe instructions in text in order to make the app more appealing.
